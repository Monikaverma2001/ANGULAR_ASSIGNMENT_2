QUESTION(A):Routing is an important concept in Angular development.
ANSWER :I
Overview of Angular Routing
Some examples of actions users take while navigating in an app include:

Entering a URL in the address bar and the browser navigates to a corresponding page
Clicking links on the page and the browser navigates to a new page
Clicking the browser's back and forward buttons and the browser navigates backward and forward through the history of pages
Angular router can interpret a browser URL as an instruction to navigate to a client-generated view.
It can pass optional parameters along to the supporting view component that help it decide what specific content to present.
You can bind the router to links on a page, and it will navigate to the appropriate application view when the user clicks a link.
f you want to navigate to different pages in your application, but you also want the application to be a SPA (Single Page Application),
with no page reloading, you can use the ngRoute module.


What is Routing in Angular?
The Angular Routing is a mechanism which is used for navigating between pages and displaying appropriate component or pages on the browser.

In other words we can say that the Routing in Angular Application helps us to navigate across the application from one one 
view to another view. It also allows us to maintain the state, implement modules, and then loads 
the modules based on the roles of the user. If this is not clear at the moment,
then donâ€™t worry, we will try to understand each and everything with examples.
